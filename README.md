#Passwprd Generator
This project is a Java console application designed to create random passwords and assess their strength.

Features
1. Password Generation:
The program prompts users to answer "Yes" or "No" to questions about including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
Users then specify the desired length of the password.
Based on the user's input, a character set is created.
The program randomly selects characters from the specified set to generate a password that meets the user's requirements.
The generated password is displayed on the console.
2. Password Strength Evaluation:
The strength checker assesses passwords based on the following criteria:

Presence of uppercase letters.
Presence of lowercase letters.
Inclusion of numbers.
Inclusion of symbols.
A minimum length of 8 characters (commonly considered the baseline for a secure password).
A length of 16 or more characters (which is generally regarded as strong).
These factors contribute to a score that determines whether the password is rated as weak, medium, strong, or very strong.

3. Security Best Practices:
Additionally, the program provides users with useful security tips, such as avoiding repeated passwords, refraining from using easily guessable sequences or patterns, and steering clear of common dictionary words.
